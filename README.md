Food for thought
---------

######  Part of my initial thought process :

I started out by asking myself,  how I would want to structure the grids around with the bootstrap grids.  Thus I started to draw out the wireframes for it.

_Disclaimer : Wireframes are more for the thought process and may not be drawn accurate to assets or scales._

Wireframe for **Desktop**:

Wireframe for **Mobile**:

######  During the process of doing it :

• Created few branches in the process of doing it, so that master branch is left untouch until css-bugs are resolved.

• Created to-do list of things (functions/view portions) during the process of building this so as to pace myself out



###### Things that could have been done better
* Refractor the CSS better. (It could have been neater using SASS)
* Positioning the Images overlay to be more smooth
* Have better naming conventions for CSS classes.
